KDANet: A Farmland Extraction Network Using Band Selection and Dual Attention Fusion

Food security is a critical global issue, and accurate monitoring of farmland is essential to address this challenge. However, farmland extraction accuracy is often hindered by variations in land types and scales. We propose the Kolmogorov–Arnold Dual Attention Multi-Feature Fusion Network (KDANet), which combines band selection with dual attention mechanisms to overcome these challenges. Using the SEaTH-Span algorithm, phenological image bands specific to farmland types are selected to optimize data effectiveness. KDANet extracts local and global features through dual attention, while the linear Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN) module fuses them to improve accuracy and stability.
